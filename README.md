## Inspiration
ExploreMiamiCoin was inspired by my struggle in understanding what MiamiCoin was and how it worked. As I did more research into CityCoins and MiamiCoin, I realized that MiamiCoin was a great way to support your city and has the potential for some great benefits for coin holders. Realizing this, I wanted to create a platform that makes MiamiCoin, and its possible benefits simple and easy for anyone to understand.

## What it does
The platform makes it easy for new and early-stage MiamiCoin holders to understand Miami Coin and its benefits to holders and to the city. ExploreMiamiCoin features an AI Chatbot named Titan, built with Google Dialogflow to address any questions that users may have and is inspired by the MiamiCoin and CityCoins documentation. The platform also shows how MIamiCoin can be used to unlock exclusive collaborative workspaces all over the city of Miami. It shows how networks can scan MiamiCoin wallets devices when entering and exiting workspaces by showing the current number of MiamiCoin holders in a workspace.

## How we built it
The platform was built using React.js, CSS, HTML, React Bootstrap, Google Dialogflow, Node.js, and Express.js.

## Challenges we ran into
Training Titan, the AI chatbot in Dialogflow was completely unfamiliar to me. I ran into challenges with connecting phrases with answers from the CityCoins documentation. Navigating intents in Dialogflow to get the AI just right was definitely a challenge that took a while to get past.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're very proud that we were able to show a concrete example of how MIamiCoin can be clearly shown to benefit the City of Miami and potential MiamiCoin holders. I believe it will convince many people on the fence to get involved with MiamiCoin.

## What we learned
I've learned the process of training an AI chatbot and multiple ways to integrate Dialogflow chatbots into web apps. I've also learned a ton about cryptocurrency, CityCoins and the MiamiCoins concept. I've learned about smart contracts, how Stacks can benefit MiamiCoin holders.

## What's next for ExploreMiamiCoin
While ExploreMiamiCoin is a great platform, if I had more time, I would work on improving Titan's AI, add maps and reviews to collaborative workspace locations, and include other benefits pages for MiamiCoin holders. One idea I had is an exclusive ridesharing service in the City of Miami. My vision is for ExploreMiamiCoin to be the platform that potential MiamiCoin holders and current MiamiCoin holders go to learn about MiamiCoin and access their benefits.
